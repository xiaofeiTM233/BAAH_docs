# Stage Exploration
::: tip

If `Use simple explore` is selected, the function to skip grid movement will be used. Please note that this will not collect all rewards, but it can increase the success rate of stage exploration (especially in the early game when your students' levels are low and you can't form a complete team).

Some grid-based stages cannot be cleared in one run to collect all rewards (Mission Objectives, Special Gift Boxes (50 Pyroxenes), and challenge achievements). For these stages, repeated battles will be performed to ensure all rewards are collected.
:::

::: warning

All automatic battles will use the game's default `AUTO` mode. Please ensure your team's levels are sufficient.

~~What? You can't even clear it manually? Well, the script definitely can't clear it either.~~
:::

Can automatically complete normal and hard stage explorations. Please ensure your team's levels are sufficient.

## Stage Exploration Configuration
Fill in the starting chapter and stage in `Explore Normal Quest` / `Explore Hard Quest`, then click the `Explore Normal Quest` / `Explore Hard Quest` button on the right to start.

## Team Configuration
### Automatic Team Matching
Check `Whether to use automatic matching` to enable this feature. Before each battle, it will enter the team configuration interface and click the `Auto` button next to the team to use BA's recommended team composition.

### Automatic Team Selection Based on Attributes
::: tip

Please check the option `Auto select team according to the attribute, if not checked, you need to manually configure the team each time` to enable this feature.

This feature does not automatically scan your configured teams to select the best one, but rather selects the most suitable team based on the weights you fill in.
:::

You need to configure your student teams for stage exploration in advance in the team configuration interface, set up different teams, and fill in the attribute weights for each team. Each cell should be filled with values from 0-10, and the script will select the most suitable team based on these weights.

Team correspondence:
![Team Correspondence](/img/explore-stage/Auto_select_team_according_to_the_attribute_1.webp)

For example, in the game, if your Team 1 is set up to fight both red and yellow armored enemies, you can set both red and yellow attack strengths to 5 in the configuration interface. This way, when encountering red or yellow armored enemies, this team will be selected.

It is not recommended to set a team as a mono-color team, as some stages may have repeated enemy types (for example, two red armored enemies). You can search online for recommended students and team composition guides for stage exploration.

~~What? You don't have enough students? Use the `Use simple explore` then. You just won't be able to collect all rewards.~~


### Manual Team Configuration

::: tip

Please uncheck the option `Auto select team according to the attribute, if not checked, you need to manually configure the team each time` to enable this feature.

:::

::: warning

When using this mode, do not execute tasks directly in the GUI. Please fill in `Explore Normal Quest` / `Explore Hard Quest` in the `Task Execution Order`, then execute the task in the terminal.
:::

This is a manual team configuration mode, where the script will automatically handle grid movement and battles, but team configuration needs to be done manually.

When this feature is enabled, before each battle, it will prompt for the required team attributes in the terminal, and then wait for you to press `Enter` to continue the task.

::: details Example

1. Check the team attributes prompted in the terminal. For example, here it prompts that Team 1 needs red attack and Team 2 needs purple attack.

3. Configure teams based on the prompt. Here, configure Team 1 with red attack and Team 2 with purple attack according to the prompts.
